<h1>ClientX/ClientY for mousedown/click/mouseup events</h1>

<p>This is a repro for <a href="crbug.com/1182909">crbug.com/1182909</a>, trying to see if clientX,clientY for
mousedown and click events are the same (or similar)</p>
<p>In order to send click event one needs to wait for mousedown/mouseup events. So it seems more likely
that the click coordinates be closer to mouseup. However I couldn't find any guarantees.</p>

<p>To reproduce please click on the button below, without releasing the left button. Move the mouse slightly inside the button and release.
You will see the coordinates clientX/clientY be different between mousedown/click events.</p>

<button id="button">Press left button on me, drag a little and release button</button>

<div id="log"></div>

<script>
let b = document.getElementById("button");
let log = document.getElementById("log");
["mousedown", "click", "mouseup"].forEach(event_name=>b.addEventListener(event_name, (e)=>{
  let logMessage = `${event_name} clientX = ${Math.floor(e.clientX)}, clientY = ${Math.floor(e.clientY)}`;
  console.log(logMessage);
  let newLogEntry = document.createElement("p");
  newLogEntry.appendChild(document.createTextNode(logMessage));
  log.appendChild(newLogEntry);
}));
</script>
